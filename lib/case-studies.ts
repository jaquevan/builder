            "MAPLE is a cross-platform mobile application developed for the Boston University Educational Technology Lab. It provides personalized learning experiences through multimedia content and adaptive assessments. The project followed a user-centered design process structured around the Double Diamond framework: Define, Discover, Design, and Deliver.",

            image: MapleImage,
            text: "The challenge was to create a mobile platform that could deliver customized educational content to students based on their learning styles and progress, while simultaneously collecting analytics for educators. The project aimed to bridge the gap between student engagement and instructional insight by combining personalization with data-driven teaching support."

            text: "Through interviews, surveys, and classroom observations, we gathered insights from both students and faculty. We learned that students struggled with rigid learning tools that did not adapt to their pace, while instructors needed actionable data to adjust their teaching strategies. These findings shaped our design principles: simplicity, engagement, adaptability, and transparency of progress."

            text: "The design process began with low-fidelity wireframes exploring navigation flows and modular content delivery. Iterative prototyping allowed us to test and refine the experience, ensuring the app was accessible, visually clear, and supportive of varied learning paths. Key features included an adaptive assessment system, intuitive dashboards for tracking progress, and offline learning capabilities for flexibility."

            text: "MAPLE was implemented using React Native for cross-platform accessibility, supported by a Node.js backend and Firebase for real-time updates and data storage. Following pilot deployment in several BU courses, the platform received strong positive feedback. Early results demonstrated a 15% increase in student engagement compared to traditional methods, validating the adaptive learning approach."

Key pages included simplified ballot questions and tailored guidance for first-time voters. In parallel, we extended design work to physical interventions: personalized voter mailers that combined census data with our user research. This hybrid digital-physical approach emphasized inclusivity, accessibility, and community-centered design."

Earlier, in Summer 2024, I polished the frontend codebase and facilitated cross-client research between the Greater Boston News Bureau and the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts. A mailer experiment reached 5,000 citizens out of a 10,000-person sample, with analysis later conducted to evaluate its impact on turnout. The project continues to evolve as a living, community-focused platform supporting civic participation."
